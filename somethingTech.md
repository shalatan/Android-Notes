## <a name='Protocols'></a>Protocols

Protocols are set of rules or standards that define how data is transmitted or received between devices on network. It ensures that devices can communicate with each other in a consistent and understood manner. Think of it as a common language that devices use to talk to each other.
Types of protocols:
- `Communication Protocols`: Communication protocols are rules that allow devices to exchange data. They can be categorized based on their function, such as messaging, ral-time communcation, email, file transfer etc.
  a. `Messaging & Presence Protocols`:
    -   SIP
    -   [ðŸ’‰](#XMPP)XMPP
    -   MQTT
    -   AMQP
- `Networking Protocols`
- `Routine Protocols`
- `Security Protocols`
- `Data Link Layer Protocols`
- `Application Layer Protocols`
- `IoT Protocols`

### <a name='XMPP'></a>XMPP
XMPP stands for Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, a communcation protocol used for instant messaging, presence information, and online collcaboration.XMPP messages are encoded in XML. 
- Key features:
  - `Decentralized archiecture`: It's decentralized, meaning anyone can setup an XMPP server, unlike centralized services like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.
  - `Real-time Communication`: Supports real-time message delivery.
  - `Extensible`: Due to XML based design, XMPP can be extended with new features, allowing developers to create custom functionalities.
  - `Security`: XMPP supports encryption protocols such as TLS and SASL for secure communications.
- WhatsApp initially used XMPP as its core messaging protocol. However, it has since customized the protocol significantly to suit its infrastructure, adding encryption and various optiomizations. It also uses **Signal Protocol** for end-to-end encryption.
- Drawbacks (why WhatsApp evolved over XMPP):
  - `Scalability Issues`:
    - XMPP is designed as decentralized protocol, while this is beneficial for small-scale, it can be challenging to optimize and control in a large-scale, ccentralized systems like WhatsApp or Messenger.
    - XMPP requires persistent TCP connections, which can strain servers when dealing with millions or billions of concurrent users.
  - `Message Delivery Optimizations`: 
    - XMPP wasn't designed to handle seamless message synchronization across multiple devices.
    - Although XMPP can handle offline messaging, optimizing this for millions of users who may come online and offline frequently is difficult at scale.
  - `Media and File Transfers`:
    - XMPP can handle basic file transfers but doesn't have built-in mechanism to optimize image, video or voice message compression and transfer.
    - XMPP focus is primarily on text-based communications, and it would require significant customization to achiece the real-time performance necessary for large-scale audio/video calls.
  - `Security & Encryption`: 
    - XMPP supports mechanism for transport-level encryption (eg using TLS) but not end-to-end encryption by default.
    - Doesn't supports large platform's specific security requirements like message self-destruction, disapperaing messages etc.
  - `Horizontal Scalability and Load Balancing`: 
    -  XMPP wasn't designed with modern cloud-native horizontal scalability in mind. Large platforms often need to scale horizontally across thousands of servers. Although clustering solutions exist for XMPP, they require significant effort to implement efficiently, and many companies prefer to develop custom solutions optimized for their infrastructure.
